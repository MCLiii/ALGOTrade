Algo trader planning

Objective is the design a modular algorithmic trading system,

General Design for a modular system
Data acquisition module:
This module is responsible for acquiring and processing the necessary market data that the trading strategy requires.

Data pre-processing module:
This module is responsible for cleaning, normalizing, and filtering the raw market data to prepare it for analysis.

Feature engineering module:
This module is responsible for generating useful features from the pre-processed data that can be used by the trading
strategy. Feature engineering may involve technical indicators, statistical measures, or other data transformations.

Trading strategy module:
This module is responsible for implementing the trading strategy using the generated features. The trading strategy can
be based on various approaches such as machine learning models, statistical arbitrage, or other techniques.

Position sizing and risk management module:
This module is responsible for determining the optimal position size for each trade based on the risk tolerance of the
trader, and for managing risk through stop-loss orders, take-profit orders, or other risk management techniques.

Execution module:
This module is responsible for executing trades based on the trading signals generated by the trading strategy.

Performance analysis module:
This module is responsible for analyzing the performance of the trading strategy and generating
performance metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, and other performance statistics.

Optimization and backtesting module:
This module is responsible for optimizing the trading strategy parameters using historical data and backtesting the
trading strategy to evaluate its effectiveness.
