The DataSource is responsible for making 2 types of operation
1. Data Gathering
    Objects for this functionality should be an inheritance of the interface DataSource.h, this helps with future
    extension of the program.

    Technical Planning:
        Calling APIs of stock exchange and collect data.
        Store the data into dataframes labeled by ordered index.
        Each data within the data frame is a class that contains the open and close time, open price, close price and volume.
        Time should be kept in unix timestamp format

        Potential setters:
            Set ticker symbol
            Set time frame, in seconds?
            Set duration into past

        Potential getters:
            a bool to indicate if the dataframe is ready
            a Dataframe containing data that's been queried
            a function to get the current price of the market

        other functionalities
            live update of the price?
            need an error handler class and each DataSource class should provide translation for errorcodes from API

        Issues to solve:
            if the ticker symbol change, what do we do with the data?
            If time frame or duration change how should we update the data?

        Backlog:
            Separate communication class for future implementation

2. Generating indicators
    For generating the indicators such as MA, EMA, MACD, consider making multiple classes for different categories of
    Stock indicators
